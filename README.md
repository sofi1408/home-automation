## Technologies used

- reactjs
- redux (for state mangement)
- service workers are used for better performance
- font awesome for icons
- jest and enzyme for unit testing

# How to run

- npm install and then npm start

## What has been done:

- I have cretaed the ux for operator and user which can be referenced in this file also you can refer the images for that in the images folder of this repo

- I have implemented the user module with different rooms and the devices in those rooms
- The rooms just dont have lights they have other devices too.
- There are different modes for different devices, light brightness settings, on and off settings
  and color settings for lights.
- Also the site is responsive.

## What has not been done:

- The admin module is still remaining for developement. The idea was to provide a checkbox for admin (due to lack of time) and then add room buttom will appear (which is implememted so far) and after that a page will apear to add rooms dynamically with the lights in that room.
- Also i could not create the ux for desktop.
